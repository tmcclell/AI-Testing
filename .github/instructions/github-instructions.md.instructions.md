# Product Requirements Document: AI-Assisted UI Automation for Testing

## Introduction and Background

Honeywell Process Solutions (HPS) uses a legacy **“native window”** application for industrial controller testing. This 40-year-old Windows-based interface requires engineers to manually monitor the screen and perform repetitive actions (mouse clicks, keystrokes) during tests. This manual process is time-consuming and prone to human error – operators must sit in front of the screen to watch for certain states and click through sequences, and there is no automated log of what they did.

**Goal:** Leverage Azure’s **Computer Use AI** (a GPT-4 powered vision-and-language model) to create an intelligent agent that can **eliminate human-to-screen interaction** during these tests. The AI agent will observe the application’s UI (via screenshots), interpret the state, decide on the next action, and simulate the necessary mouse/keyboard inputs to drive the test forward – **just as a human tester would, but automatically.** By doing so, we aim to **reduce human monitoring time to nearly zero** for routine test sequences. Engineers would only need to intervene if something unexpected occurs, rather than babysitting each test step.

**Context:** In previous discussions, Honeywell indicated they have an existing OCR-based automation tool. That tool can read screen text and perform pre-scripted inputs (effectively moving a cursor with arrow keys and pressing a “+” key to signal a click) on this legacy UI. However, it lacks intelligent decision-making – it follows a fixed script and cannot adapt if the system is slow or if an unexpected screen pops up. The proposed AI agent will go beyond by using cognitive abilities to understand when the environment is in the correct state for the next action and handle variability (for example, waiting for a load to complete before clicking the next button).

Microsoft demonstrated a prototype where an AI agent successfully interpreted a desktop screenshot and controlled applications (e.g. opening a calculator and performing calculations) using the **Azure OpenAI “Computer Use” model**. This gave confidence that the technology can work on the HPS use case. Key challenges noted were ensuring the AI focuses on the correct window (especially in multi-monitor setups) and managing the latency of cloud-based AI calls for each action. These challenges will be addressed in this PRD via requirements for window selection configuration and performance considerations.

It was also discussed that in the long term, such an AI agent could incorporate more advanced reasoning – for instance, monitoring system log files or telemetry in parallel to predict failures (anomaly detection across networked controllers). While that is outside the scope of the initial implementation, the design should leave room for integrating such capabilities in the future.

In summary, this PRD focuses on building an **AI-driven UI automation system** for the HPS test application that will operate locally (on Windows or Linux test machines) with cloud-based intelligence from Azure. It will mimic the full sequence of human actions and decisions needed to carry out test procedures, thereby **automating the testing process end-to-end** and freeing human operators from direct screen interactions.

## Objectives and Goals

**Primary Objective:** Develop an AI agent that can **fully automate the interaction with the HPS test application’s UI**, eliminating the need for a human to manually click through test sequences or watch the screen for events. Success means tests can be run unattended, with the AI performing all necessary steps and validations.

To achieve this, the solution will pursue the following key goals:

- **Eliminate Manual UI Interaction:** The agent will handle all UI navigation and input. Every button press, menu navigation, and data entry that a human would do, the AI will do autonomously. For example, opening the system status screen, selecting a controller, and clicking the “Swap” button will be performed by the AI without human assistance.

- **Autonomously Detect Readiness:** The AI will **detect when the system is in the correct state for the next action**. It will wait for visual cues (such as a specific status message or screen appearance) before proceeding, just as a human would wait for a screen to finish loading. This ensures the agent’s actions are correctly timed and prevents errors like clicking a button that isn’t active yet.

- **Run Locally with Azure Intelligence:** The execution (taking screenshots, sending keystrokes) will run on the local test machine (supporting both Windows and Linux environments), but the **“brain” of the agent will utilize Azure’s AI**. This hybrid approach means the sensitive control system is not directly exposed to the internet beyond sending images to Azure for analysis. The local agent will maintain control, and if needed, could be containerized or sandboxed for safety.

- **Improve Testing Efficiency and Coverage:** By automating interactions, tests can be run faster and more frequently. The AI doesn’t get tired or bored, so it can execute long repetitive cycles (overnight or over weekends) that humans might avoid. This allows for stress testing and long-duration tests that were previously impractical. It also means multiple test stations could run in parallel without increasing headcount.

- **Logging and Traceability:** The agent will produce a detailed log of every action and observation. Currently, when a human tests, there’s **no automatic record of clicks or cursor movements**. The AI will log each step (e.g. “Clicked ‘System Status’ at 10:05:23”, “Observed controller status = OFFLINE”). This provides traceability for debugging and for verifying test steps after the fact. It effectively creates a play-by-play transcript of the test.

- **Maintain or Improve Accuracy:** The AI should be at least as accurate as a human in reading the screen and performing actions. It must correctly recognize UI elements (buttons, labels) and not click the wrong thing. It should also reliably detect when outcomes are correct or not (for instance, recognizing the difference between a normal status and an error status on screen). The goal is that using the AI does not introduce new errors; if anything, it reduces errors by being consistent and fastidious in checking the screen.

- **Lay Groundwork for Advanced Monitoring:** While the initial scope is UI automation, the system should be designed with future expansion in mind. Honeywell is interested in **advanced reasoning** such as having the AI monitor system logs or multi-system telemetry to anticipate failures. The architecture should allow incorporation of such data streams later (for example, feeding log text into the AI’s context). This ensures the investment is forward-compatible with broader autonomous testing and monitoring goals.

By meeting these goals, the outcome will be a significant improvement in the productivity of HPS’s testing process. Instead of an engineer spending hours clicking and watching for a failure, the AI can do so, and the engineer can focus on analyzing results and addressing any issues the AI finds.

## Example Use Case and User Story

To illustrate the requirements, consider a real use case discussed with HPS engineers: **performing N redundant controller swap tests on controllers 17 and 18 in network UCN 07**. Currently, a human tester would do the following:

1. **Navigate to System Status:** Starting from the main menu (labeled “Engineering Main Menu”), the tester clicks the **System Status** button. The application opens the System Status screen, which lists various nodes in the system (such as network modules, controllers, etc.).

2. **Select the Target Network:** On the System Status screen, the tester locates the entry for network **UCN 07** (shown as node **NM 44** in the list). Using the keyboard arrow keys, the tester highlights **NM 44**. Then they press the **“NTWK/HWY STATUS”** button (equivalent to clicking it) to open the Network/Highway Status details for that network.

3. **Initiate a Controller Swap:** In the Network Status screen for UCN 07, the tester sees the pair of redundant controllers labeled **17 HPM 18** (indicating Controllers 17 and 18, model type HPM, one primary and one backup). The tester clicks on **“Run States”**, then clicks **“Swap Primary”**. A confirmation dialog appears showing the pair "17  HPM  18" (meaning controller 17 is currently primary). The tester presses **Enter** (or the on-screen **Enter** button) to confirm the swap. This triggers the system to swap the roles of controllers 17 and 18: the primary controller will reboot and the backup will take over as primary.

4. **Observe the Outcome:** After initiating the swap, the tester watches the status indicators for that controller pair. Initially, one controller goes offline for reboot. The status might change to something like **“PARTFAIL / OFFLINE”** during the reboot. The tester waits until the status changes back to **“PARTFAIL / BKUP_PF”** (partial failure with a backup in place), indicating that the rebooted controller has come back up as the backup and the swap was successful. Essentially, they expect to see the system return to the same state as before the swap (one primary, one backup, with a minor “partfail” status that is normal in this test environment).

5. **Repeat for N Iterations:** The tester repeats the swap operation **N** times (e.g., 5 or 10 times) or until a failure is detected. If at any iteration something goes wrong – for example, if after a swap the status shows **“OFFLINE / OFFLINE”** (both controllers down, which should never happen in a healthy redundant pair) or any abnormal condition – the tester notes that as a failure and stops the test. Otherwise, they continue until all N swaps are completed successfully.

Throughout this process, the human tester is exercising judgment: waiting for screens to load, recognizing when the status text changes, deciding if it matches expected outcomes, and knowing when to stop due to an error. They are also performing precise input actions via the keyboard: using arrow keys to navigate the UI (since the UI doesn’t have a modern mouse interface, the **“+” key on the numpad is used to simulate a left-click** when an item is highlighted) and pressing Enter to confirm dialogs.

**What the AI Agent Will Do:** The AI agent should be able to carry out this exact scenario without intervention. It will:
- Recognize the main menu and locate the “System Status” button on the screenshot, then issue the command to activate it.
- On the System Status screen, identify the entry for “NM 44 – UCN 07”. It will simulate the arrow key presses to move the selection to that entry, then activate the “NTWK/HWY STATUS” button (again via the “+” key or equivalent).
- In the Network Status screen, find the “Swap Primary” option (likely after clicking “Run States” menu if required) and activate it. Then confirm the swap on the dialog by selecting the correct line (“17  HPM  18”) if needed and pressing Enter.
- Wait and watch the status values for controllers 17 and 18. Continuously analyze screenshots to detect when the status text changes from “OFFLINE” back to “BKUP_PF” (or a timeout elapses). Only proceed to the next iteration when the expected post-swap state is observed.
- Loop this process the specified number of times, keeping count, and break out of the loop early if an unexpected error state is detected (e.g., both controllers offline).
- Log each iteration’s actions (e.g., “Swap #3 initiated, waiting for recovery…”) and results (“Swap #3 completed successfully in 45 seconds” or “Swap #3 failed: controllers did not return to expected state”).

At the end of the run, the AI will produce a summary stating whether all swaps passed or if a failure occurred (and at which iteration). It will also have a log file detailing each step.

This use case highlights several requirements: the need for the AI to navigate menus, read dynamic text from the screen, make decisions (repeat or stop on error), and interface with the system using specific keys. These are captured in the functional requirements below. The example also shows why timing and state-checking are critical (the agent must wait for a controller to come back online). All these expectations from the human tester now become responsibilities of the AI system.

## Functional Requirements

The AI automation system must fulfill the following **functional requirements**:

1. **UI State Perception:** The system must be able to **capture the visual state of the application and interpret it correctly**. This involves taking screenshots of the application’s window and using an AI model to identify UI elements (buttons, fields, highlighted selections) and read text (like status messages) on the screen. For example, the agent should detect when the text “PARTFAIL / OFFLINE” appears or when a certain menu item is highlighted. High accuracy in perception is critical: if the agent misreads the screen, it could make a wrong decision. _(*This replaces the human’s eyes.*)_

2. **Intent Understanding and Task Planning:** Given a high-level instruction or goal (e.g., “perform 10 swaps on controllers 17/18”), the AI agent must break it down into the necessary sequence of UI actions. This is essentially the AI’s planning capability: it should determine the steps like “open System Status, select network, open Network Status, click Swap, verify outcome, repeat.” The model should be capable of interpreting natural language descriptions of tasks or be pre-configured with sequences for known tasks. This requirement ensures the system isn’t hard-coded only for one scenario – it can adapt to variations of tasks by leveraging AI reasoning. _(*This replaces the human’s understanding of the test procedure.*)_

3. **Controlled Execution of Actions:** The system must execute UI actions reliably, **simulating keyboard and mouse input** to the application just as a user would. This includes:
   - Pressing keys (e.g., arrow keys to navigate a list, the “+” key to simulate left-click on the highlighted item, Enter to confirm a dialog).
   - Moving the mouse cursor and clicking, if needed (though in the HPS app, keyboard navigation might suffice for all interactions).
   
   The agent should use the appropriate method for the context; for the HPS test app, it’s known that **arrow keys and the “+” key can accomplish all interactions**, so the agent will utilize those. The execution needs to be precise – for example, if a certain item needs to be double-clicked or a key held down, the system should support that. _(*This replaces the human’s hands on the keyboard/mouse.*)_

4. **Environment Readiness Detection:** After each action, the system must determine **when the application is ready for the next step**. This means implementing wait logic: for instance, after clicking “Swap”, the agent should continuously or periodically check the screen to see if the resulting status change has occurred. Only once the expected UI change is detected (or a reasonable timeout passes) can it proceed. This requirement ensures the agent doesn’t race ahead – it mimics the human habit of waiting for a visual confirmation before moving on. If the next screen takes 30 seconds to appear, the agent should patiently wait those 30 seconds (perhaps with a timeout like 60 seconds to declare an error if nothing happens).

5. **Looping and Conditional Logic:** The system must support automating repetitive actions and basic decision-making. In many test cases, a set of steps needs to be repeated multiple times (looping) or until a condition is met. The agent should be able to:
   - Repeat a sequence X number of times as specified.
   - Keep track of loop counters and break out of the loop if a certain condition is met (e.g., an error occurs or a desired state is reached).
   - Handle conditional branches in the workflow (for example: “if an error dialog appears at any point, click ‘OK’, log the error, and abort the test”). 
   
   This logic can be guided by either the AI’s reasoning or pre-defined scripts that the agent follows, but the key is flexibility to not just follow a single linear path always.

6. **Result Verification:** The system must verify that each action achieved the expected result. This means embedding the test’s pass/fail criteria into the agent’s behavior. For instance, after a controller swap, the agent should check the status of the controllers to confirm that one is backup and one is primary again (as expected). If the result is not as expected, the agent should flag this. Essentially, the AI should act not only as an executor but also as a tester, evaluating the outcome of each step against what’s supposed to happen. This might use the same perception capability (reading text or values on screen) and comparing them to expected values.

7. **Logging of Actions and Events:** The system shall keep a detailed **log of everything it does and observes**. Each user action (keystroke, mouse click) should be logged with a timestamp and a description (e.g., “Pressed + (click) on ‘Swap Primary’ button”). Similarly, significant observations or decisions should be logged (“Waited 15s for controller status to return to normal”). This log serves multiple purposes: it provides a trace for debugging, it gives test engineers confidence about what was done, and it can be used as evidence in reports. The log should be written to a persistent file and possibly also printed to console in real-time for live monitoring.

8. **Test Reporting:** In addition to the raw log, the system should produce a concise **summary report** at the end of a test run. For example: “**Test Result:** 10/10 swaps completed successfully. No errors encountered.” Or if an error happened: “Test stopped at iteration 7 due to unexpected OFFLINE status on both controllers.” The report might include the total time taken, any specific error codes or screenshots of failure states if available. This summary makes it easy for an engineer to see the outcome without parsing the entire log.

9. **Error Handling and Safety Stops:** The agent must handle unexpected situations gracefully. If at any point the AI is unsure of what to do or detects an anomaly (like an unknown popup window), it should pause or stop with an error rather than continue blindly. Concretely, this means:
   - If the AI’s interpretation confidence is low (e.g., it isn’t sure which button is “Swap” because the screen is distorted), it should stop and ask for human assistance or at least log that it’s uncertain.
   - If the application under test crashes or becomes unresponsive (no screen update for a long time), the agent should detect this (via timeouts) and stop the test, logging the condition.
   - The agent should have a configurable **kill switch** or abort mechanism (for example, if a certain key sequence is pressed by a human or a certain file flag is set, the agent will stop) to ensure a human can intervene if needed.
   - The actions the AI can perform should be constrained to prevent harm: e.g., not allowed to close the application or shutdown the system unless explicitly it’s part of the test scope. This avoids the AI performing destructive actions on a misinterpretation.

10. **Multi-Platform Support (Windows/Linux):** The core agent should be able to run on both Windows and Linux environments. The primary target is a Windows 10/11 machine (since the HPS application is Windows-based), but some test setups might have the application in a Windows VM on a Linux host or use a Linux environment for orchestration. Therefore:
    - On Windows, the agent will use OS-specific methods (Win32 API or automation libraries) to capture the screen and send input.
    - On Linux, if the application is run via an emulator or remote desktop, the agent might need to capture that window or possibly run in a container. At minimum, the planning and decision logic should be OS-agnostic, and an abstraction layer should handle differences in capture/input.
    - This requirement ensures flexibility in deployment — HPS test environments vary, and the solution shouldn’t be tightly coupled to one OS. (If needed, the initial version can focus on Windows with a plan to extend to Linux, but the design should not preclude Linux support.)

11. **Integration with Test Infrastructure:** The system should integrate with existing test execution frameworks or Continuous Integration systems. This means it should be possible to start a test via a command-line interface or API call, possibly passing parameters (like which test scenario to run, how many iterations, etc.). For example, a test script could invoke `ai_agent.exe --scenario swap_test --count 10`. Similarly, the results should be output in a format that can be consumed by other tools (perhaps a JSON summary or an exit code for success/failure). This requirement is about making the AI agent a plug-and-play component in the broader testing workflow, not a standalone tool that requires manual operation.

12. **Configurable Parameters:** The agent should allow configuration of important parameters without code changes. This includes:
    - Number of iterations/loops to perform.
    - Timeouts for waiting on certain actions (how long to wait for a screen to appear or a status to update before giving up).
    - Paths for output logs and reports.
    - Toggle for certain features (e.g., an option to enable a slower “step-by-step debug mode” vs. fast mode).
    - Credentials or connection info if the app requires login (ensuring these can be provided securely).
    
    A configuration file (e.g., YAML or JSON) or command-line flags can be used. Default values should be sensible, so the agent works out-of-the-box for typical cases, but testers can tweak as needed for different scenarios or environments.

13. **Future Multimodal Extension (Log Analysis):** Though not required for initial deployment, the design must accommodate future inputs beyond just the UI. Specifically, the architecture should allow incorporating **system log data or external signals** into the AI’s decision process. In a future version, for instance, the agent could also read from a log file that the controllers produce, to cross-verify what it sees on screen or to predict issues (like if a log line indicates an impending fault, the agent might wait or handle it). Practically, this means using a modular approach where new data sources can be added to the agent’s context that gets sent to the AI model. While the implementation of this is future work, we list it as a requirement to ensure the system is designed with extension in mind (e.g., not hard-coding the prompt to only include screenshot data, but allowing additional text context).

## Non-Functional Requirements

Aside from performing correctly, the system must meet several non-functional criteria to be viable in a production test environment:

- **Accuracy and Reliability:** The AI agent’s actions must be reliable. It should very rarely mis-click or mis-read information. We aim for the agent to complete test workflows with a success rate comparable to a human expert (for routine cases, near 100% success with no mistakes). Any drop in accuracy undermines trust. Reliability also means consistent behavior: running the same test twice should yield the same sequence of actions and results (unless the system under test behaves differently). The agent should have self-checks to ensure it’s operating on the correct window (e.g., verify the window title is as expected to avoid interacting with the wrong application).

- **Performance (Speed):** The agent should perform actions in a timely manner. It is understood that calling an AI service introduces some latency (each perception+decision step might take a second or two). However, the test execution time should not become impractically long. As a guideline, the AI-driven test should ideally not take more than, say, 1.5x the time a human would take for the same steps. If a human does the 10 swaps in 10 minutes, the AI might take 15 minutes, which is acceptable given it frees human time. But if the AI took an hour due to waiting on the model, that would be problematic. We will optimize performance by minimizing unnecessary waits (e.g., polling the screen efficiently, and perhaps using a smaller region of interest for OCR if possible). Also, the local processing (capturing screens, injecting inputs) should be lightweight enough not to slow down the application under test (no heavy resource usage that could interfere with the controllers).

- **Platform Compatibility:** (Closely tied to the functional requirement on multi-platform support) The system should be deployable on both Windows and Linux environments with minimal modifications. If certain features are only available on one platform initially, those should be clearly documented and a path for cross-platform support should be planned. For Windows, ensure compatibility with common versions (Windows 10, 11, and Windows Server if applicable in labs). For Linux, target a common distribution used in labs (e.g., Ubuntu LTS) and ensure the capture/input approach works (perhaps using X11 interfaces or running the Windows app in WINE or VM). In either case, the installation should include all dependencies (libraries, drivers) needed for that OS.

- **Security:** The agent will effectively have control of a machine, so it must be designed securely to avoid misuse or unintended consequences.
  - Run the agent with the least privileges necessary. It should not require admin rights to function (unless absolutely needed for capturing the screen on Windows – if so, that should be clearly pointed out and mitigated).
  - The communication with Azure AI must use secure channels (HTTPS) and API keys or tokens must be protected. No sensitive data (like proprietary screen contents) should be sent to Azure without proper agreements in place (assuming this is covered under existing Honeywell-Microsoft cloud usage terms and NDAs).
  - If possible, keep the system off the public internet except for the Azure endpoint. If the test machine has restricted network access, document the required endpoints/ports so that firewall rules can be set accordingly.
  - The agent should only operate within its intended context: for instance, if two instances of the application are open, it should either handle both separately or clearly attach to one, to avoid messing with an unintended window. 
  - All actions should be logged (as per functional req), which also serves as an audit trail for security – nothing the agent does is invisible.

- **Usability (for Test Engineers):** The tool should be user-friendly for its intended users (test and validation engineers, who may not be AI experts). This means:
  - Easy installation and setup (e.g., an installer or a Docker container with everything pre-configured).
  - Simple start of a run: as mentioned, a one-command execution for a given scenario. They shouldn’t have to orchestrate multiple steps to get it going.
  - Clear output during execution: the engineer should see some real-time feedback, whether it’s a console log or a small GUI that updates status (e.g., “Iteration 3/10 in progress…”).
  - Documentation and help: provide a README or user guide with examples of how to configure and launch tests, and how to interpret logs and reports. Also include troubleshooting tips (like “if the agent cannot find the window, do X”).
  - The user should not need to modify code. Any adjustments should be via the config or by providing different input files (for example, a script of high-level instructions) rather than changing the program.
  - If possible, provide a way to **visualize what the AI is seeing/doing** during a run (for example, perhaps an option to save screenshots the AI takes on each step, annotated with what it recognized – this can greatly help in debugging and trust-building).

- **Maintainability and Modularity:** The system should be built in a modular way such that components (like the vision model, or the input controller) can be updated independently. For instance, if a new, better Azure model becomes available, we should be able to switch to it without rewriting the whole agent. The code should be clear and well-structured, with comments and perhaps configuration-driven logic for different UI elements (so if tomorrow a new button is added in the app, an engineer can update a config file or prompt instructions rather than delving into code). We will maintain version control for the agent’s code and have a process for incorporating improvements or fixes. 

- **Scalability:** While the initial deployment might be on one machine, the design should allow scaling out. For example, if Honeywell wants to run 5 test stations with 5 AI agents concurrently, this should be feasible (given sufficient Azure capacity and separate machines). The architecture should not have a single point of failure or bottleneck that prevents multiple instances from running in parallel. Each agent will run independently, and any cloud components (like the Azure AI service) should be able to handle multiple simultaneous requests (we may need to consider rate limits of the AI API and use different service instances or proper request throttling as needed).

- **Network Resilience:** Since the solution depends on cloud AI, it should handle network issues. If the network connection to Azure is slow or temporarily drops:
  - The agent should detect this and retry requests a few times.
  - If network is unavailable for a prolonged period, the agent should timeout and provide a meaningful error (“Cannot reach Azure AI service. Check internet connection.”).
  - In the long run, if connectivity is a frequent issue, an option to run the AI model on-premises (if Azure provides a containerized version) could be considered; the architecture should allow switching the model endpoint easily (perhaps via config, pointing to a different URI).

- **Compliance and Data Privacy:** Ensure that using the AI and capturing screens does not violate any data privacy or regulatory compliance requirements that Honeywell might have. For example, if the screenshots might contain sensitive information, confirm that Azure’s service usage is under acceptable terms (Azure OpenAI is typically used under MS enterprise agreements that cover data handling). If needed, implement additional data protection, such as blurring parts of the screen that are not relevant or avoiding sending any more data than necessary. Additionally, the system should not store sensitive data locally beyond what is needed for logs (and those logs should be treated as confidential test data).

- **Safety (Fail-Safe Operation):** In an industrial context, even though this is “just” a test, we ensure that the agent will not cause any harmful operations. The HPS application is presumably being used in a test lab environment (not controlling actual live plant equipment when the tests are running). We assume that risk to real operations is mitigated by using a test environment. Nonetheless, the agent should be constrained to the test’s boundaries: it shouldn’t, for instance, attempt to change configurations outside the scope of the test. If an unintended situation arises, the default action is to stop and alert, rather than attempt something unpredictable. This conservative approach prioritizes safety and trust.

In summary, the non-functional requirements ensure the AI solution is **trustworthy, efficient, and easy to adopt**. The success of this project not only depends on the AI working, but also on test engineers having confidence in it and being able to integrate it seamlessly into their workflow. These criteria will guide development and deployment choices alongside the core functionality.

## Technical Architecture and Integration

The system will consist of a local automation client working in tandem with cloud-based AI services. Below is an outline of the main components and their interactions:

- **Screen Capture Module:** This module is responsible for grabbing the current screenshot of the application under test. On Windows, it might use the Win32 APIs or libraries like DirectX or GDI to capture the window’s bitmap. On Linux, it could use X11 or Wayland screenshot utilities. It may have the ability to focus on a specific window (by title or handle) to avoid capturing irrelevant parts of the screen (important if other windows are open). This module will likely provide an image in memory (or disk) to be sent to the AI analysis. Performance considerations: capture only as frequently as needed (e.g., on demand when the AI needs an updated image) and possibly limit the area (if we know only a certain region of the screen contains changing info, though initially it will probably send the full app window).

- **Azure AI Analysis:** This is the cloud AI component (using Azure’s “Computer Vision + Language” model, akin to GPT-4 with image understanding). The local agent will send the screenshot and a textual prompt describing the context to this service. For example, the prompt might be: “You are viewing the Honeywell test application. The user’s goal is to swap controllers. Currently, this is the screen: [image]. What action should be taken next?” The Azure service will respond with the next suggested action and possibly a rationale. (In implementation, the prompt design will be more controlled to ensure deterministic outputs, possibly using few-shot examples or specific instructions to the model.) The output might be something like: “NextAction: Press the ‘Swap Primary’ button.” The local system will parse this output.

- **Action Execution Module:** Based on the AI’s decision, this module will **send the actual input to the application**. For the HPS app, this likely means sending keystrokes via the OS. For example, if the next action is “press Swap Primary”, the module might translate that into a sequence: focus the app window, send the key presses that navigate the UI to the Swap button (if not already focused), then send the “+” key to activate it. On Windows, this can be done with the SendInput API or automation libraries (like PyAutoGUI if using Python, or a tool like Power Automate scripts). On Linux, xdotool or similar tools could simulate keypresses. This module must be tightly connected with the specifics of the application’s UI controls (it may have a map of actions to key sequences or coordinates). After executing an action, it could also trigger a short delay or immediately call screen capture for the next cycle.

- **Agent Control Flow (Orchestrator):** This is the core logic that orchestrates the above modules. It implements the state machine or loop of the test procedure. It keeps track of where we are in the sequence (e.g., “just clicked Swap, now waiting for status update”), how many iterations have been done, and what the high-level goal is. It will form the prompts for the AI, incorporating relevant context (like “we have done 3 swaps out of 10, controller status is now X, what next?”). It also applies any hard rules (for safety, as discussed in error handling – e.g., if the AI suggests an action that is not allowed like closing the app, the control logic will override or ignore that). Essentially, this component is the “brain” that decides when to call the AI, when to execute actions, when to loop or stop, and manages the sequence of steps to fulfill the test objective.

- **Memory/Context Handling:** (Part of the control flow) Because the AI model calls are stateless (each call doesn’t automatically remember previous calls), the agent needs to maintain context. This could be done by building a conversation history that is sent to the model on each request (e.g., “Previous steps: 1) Opened System Status [success], 2) Selected network [success]... Current screen: [image].”). Alternatively, the system may handle most of the sequence logic itself and use the AI mainly for recognizing the screen and determining the next step, one step at a time. In any case, maintaining context about what has been done and what is still to do is important, so the agent doesn’t lose track mid-test.

- **Logging & Reporting Module:** Every action or decision the agent makes is fed into this module to append to a log file (and console output). This module timestamps each entry and ensures the log is flushed to disk frequently (to prevent loss of information in case of a crash). It also gathers summary info (number of steps, any errors) to produce the final test report at the end. If the system is integrated with test management software, this module might also handle sending the result to that system (or simply formatting the output in a way that’s easy to copy-paste into a report).

- **Configuration Management:** The agent will load configuration at startup, such as the number of iterations to perform or the target model endpoint to use. This could be done via a config file or arguments. Internally, a Config object will provide these values to the other components. For example, it might specify the window title of the application (so that the capture module knows what to look for), or a mapping of UI labels to keyboard commands (if we know certain shortcuts). This makes the agent adaptable to slight differences in environment without code changes.

- **User Interface (CLI/GUI):** Initially, a simple CLI might suffice to run the agent, but a lightweight GUI could be provided for convenience. For instance, a small window where a user can choose a scenario from a dropdown (“Swap Test”, “Startup Sequence Test”, etc.), enter parameters, and click Start, then see a live log output area. This UI is not strictly necessary for functionality but improves usability. In either case, the interface should also allow a user to abort an ongoing test safely.

- **Integration Layer:** If we want other software to trigger the agent, we could have the agent listen for commands (e.g., a REST API or a message queue). This might be overkill for now, but designing with this in mind means ensuring the agent can run headless without user interaction and can be started and stopped by external calls. Possibly, we won’t implement a full API in the first version, but we will structure the code so that it would be easy to wrap an API around the core logic later.

**Workflow:** Putting it together, a typical cycle would be:
1. **Initialization:** Load config, set up logging, capture initial screen.
2. **AI Call:** Send screen (and context) to Azure AI, get action decision.
3. **Execute Action:** Through the control module, possibly after validating the action is safe/allowed.
4. **Post-action:** Capture screen again (or multiple times to monitor progress) and/or check conditions.
5. **Logging:** Log what was done and observed.
6. **Loop/Next Step:** Decide next prompt for AI or next step (depending on if we script some parts).
7. **Termination:** When the scenario is complete or an error occurs, finalize logs and report.

This loop continues until the test objective is met or aborted. Throughout, the agent ensures the application stays in focus and the correct window is controlled. If multiple monitors are present, we’ll programmatically specify which monitor or window handle to capture, to avoid the AI getting confused by extraneous data.

The **integration with Azure** will be through a secure REST API. We will likely use Azure OpenAI’s REST endpoint with an image encoded (perhaps first uploaded to blob storage or sent as base64 in the JSON, depending on what the service supports). This means the agent machine needs network access to Azure OpenAI. If latency is an issue for each call, we might explore sending a batch of requests (though the sequential nature probably requires waiting for one step’s result before the next).

Lastly, we will ensure the architecture is documented so that Honeywell’s team understands how the pieces communicate. For instance, if they have security reviews, we can show that “Module X sends image data to Azure via HTTPS, receives back text; no other external communication.” The modular approach also means if any part needs to be replaced (e.g. if a different OCR engine is to be used instead of Azure for some reason), it can be done without rewriting the whole system.

In summary, the architecture is a **hybrid AI agent**: local execution for real-time control and a cloud AI for intelligent decision-making. It balances the strengths of cloud AI (powerful vision/language understanding) with the requirements of local control (speed, security, offline capability to some extent). The design is flexible enough to integrate into Honeywell’s existing processes and to evolve as new features are needed.

## Testing and Validation

To ensure the AI automation system works as intended and is trustworthy, a comprehensive testing strategy will be followed:

- **Unit Testing of Modules:** Each component of the agent will be tested in isolation where possible. For example, test the screen capture module by verifying it grabs the correct region of the screen (perhaps by checking image dimensions or known pixel values when a dummy test pattern is displayed). The action execution module can be unit-tested by directing inputs to a trivial app (like sending keystrokes to Notepad and verifying text appears). These unit tests help catch platform-specific issues early (e.g., ensure the key-sending works on Windows 11, or that our image encoding to Azure is correct).

- **Simulation Tests with a Mock UI:** Before testing on the actual HPS application, we’ll create or use a **mock application** with known UI elements to validate the end-to-end loop. For instance, use a simple GUI that has a few buttons and messages that the AI can practice on. Or use a standard application (like the Calculator or a simple menu-based app) to let the agent try performing tasks. This will allow tuning of the prompt and checking that the AI model correctly interprets screens in a controlled scenario. We can script expected outputs (for example, if we show a screen with the text “Press OK to continue,” does the agent indeed say “NextAction: Press OK”). These tests ensure that the AI + action pipeline is working and help adjust prompt wording, etc., without risking the real system.

- **Functional Testing on the Target Application:** Gradually test the agent on the actual Honeywell application. Start with small tasks: e.g., simply navigate to the System Status screen and stop. Verify it did so correctly. Then increase complexity: navigate to Network Status and back, etc. Finally, attempt the full controller swap sequence with the AI in a controlled setting. During these tests, developers and HPS engineers will likely watch the agent’s behavior to see if it matches expectations. Any misstep will be noted and the cause determined (was it a perception error? a logic error? timing issue?). We will iterate until the agent can reliably perform the entire scenario. We’ll test not just one happy-path run, but multiple runs to see consistency. Additionally, intentionally provoke some error conditions if possible: for instance, simulate a slower system response to see if the agent waits properly, or simulate a failure (maybe by disconnecting a controller to see if the agent recognizes an OFFLINE/OFFLINE state and handles it).

- **Performance Testing:** Measure the time the agent takes for operations in various conditions. We will create tests to benchmark the latency of the AI calls (e.g., how long does it take to analyze a typical screenshot and return an answer) and the overall time to complete a sequence versus a human baseline. If performance is below expectations, investigate where the bottlenecks are (network latency? image size too large? too many redundant steps?) and optimize. We will also test the agent’s resource usage on the local machine (CPU, memory) to ensure it does not, for example, consume so much CPU that the controller simulation is affected or that it causes OS hangs. The system should ideally run on a standard lab PC without special hardware.

- **Robustness Testing (Edge Cases):** We will test unusual scenarios to ensure the agent can handle them or at least fail safely:
  - Run the agent when the application is not open or not at the expected start screen – it should detect “app not found” and not do random things.
  - Pop-up handling: We might introduce a dummy pop-up (like an unrelated dialog) during a run to see if the agent gets confused. The agent should ideally notice an unknown window and pause rather than interacting blindly.
  - Multi-monitor: If the test machine has multiple displays, ensure the agent is configured to capture the correct display or window. We can test with two monitors turned on, perhaps with another application on the second monitor, to see that the agent stays focused. We expect to adjust the capture module to target the specific window of interest (thus ignoring extra monitors).
  - Network loss: Disconnect the machine from the network in the middle of a run (in a test environment) to see that the AI call fails gracefully and the agent reports a network error without crashing. Reconnect and maybe allow it to resume if that’s feasible.
  - High iteration counts: Run a very long test (say 50 iterations of swap) to ensure there are no memory leaks or accumulation of lag in the system’s performance over time.

- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Involve the end users (Honeywell test engineers) in testing the system in real-world conditions. After internal testing shows the agent works on the target scenario, let the engineers use it on their own, perhaps initially under supervision. They will evaluate:
  - Does the agent consistently do what it’s supposed to in their environment?
  - Is it truly not requiring intervention? (Early on, they might be tempted to step in if they think it's stuck – this will be a learning process for users to trust the agent.)
  - Are the logs and outputs understandable to them? We will gather their feedback: maybe they want clearer messages, or they might identify additional checks that need to be in place.
  - Does it handle variations in the test? (Engineers might try slightly different tasks to see if the agent can adapt. This could surface new feature requests or necessary generalizations.)

If the UAT reveals any issues (for example, “when our system is under heavy load, the agent misreads a flashing alert message”), those will be added to the refinement backlog and addressed if critical.

- **Regression Testing:** As we refine the agent (tweaking the AI prompt, code changes to fix issues), we will repeatedly run our library of tests (unit, simulation, functional) to ensure new changes don’t break previously working features. Over time, we’ll accumulate a set of test cases (including perhaps recorded screens from the application for specific tricky scenarios) that we can feed to the system in automation to validate it continues to handle them.

- **Validation Against Requirements:** We will create a traceability matrix to ensure each requirement listed in this PRD is tested. For example:
  - For “logging every action,” we will check the log file in tests to confirm every user action appears.
  - For “handles N loops,” we might test 1 loop vs 5 loops vs 0 loops (maybe an edge case of 0 should just not run at all but exit gracefully) to see that looping logic is solid.
  - For “multi-platform,” at least do a dry run or partial test on a Linux environment.
  - Security review: we might do a code review or use static analysis tools to ensure there are no glaring vulnerabilities (since this is an internal tool, formal security testing might be light, but we keep it in mind).

Throughout the testing phase, we will maintain close communication with the Honeywell team, providing them test reports and getting their sign-off when the agent meets the acceptance criteria. We expect an iterative test/fix cycle, especially to fine-tune the AI’s behavior.

Finally, before deployment, a formal **acceptance test** will be run: e.g., “Agent will perform 10 swaps in a row on a given test system without any human intervention and all will succeed.” If it passes, that’s a green light to deploy in the production test lab environment.

## Deployment Plan

Deploying the AI-assisted testing system involves setting up both the cloud service side and the local agent on test machines, and ensuring users are prepared to use it. Key steps in the deployment plan:

- **Azure Service Configuration:** Make sure the required Azure OpenAI service (or equivalent) is provisioned in Honeywell’s Azure tenant or accessible via Microsoft’s subscription as agreed. We’ll secure the API keys and endpoint URLs. If this is a private preview feature, ensure whitelisted access is in place for the Honeywell project. This step also includes configuring any required Azure resources like storage (if we decide to log screenshots or large data, though initially we send them transiently).

- **Local Installation Package:** Prepare an installer or deployment package for the AI agent. This could be delivered as:
  - A standalone executable or script with all dependencies bundled (for Windows, maybe an MSI or a self-extracting installer; for Linux, perhaps a Docker container or a .deb package).
  - The package will install the agent program, a default configuration file, and documentation. It should also place a shortcut or script for ease of launching.
  - Include in the package any needed runtime (for example, if using Python, either freeze it to an EXE with PyInstaller or include a Python runtime in the installer).
  - After installation, a user should be able to modify a config file (for advanced settings like the Azure endpoint URL or API key) and then launch the agent.

- **Test Environment Preparation:** On each test machine where the agent will run:
  - Ensure the Honeywell test application is installed and configured as it would be for a human tester.
  - If the machine requires certain display settings (e.g., a specific resolution or scaling for the AI to work best), configure those. Possibly set the machine to never lock or sleep during tests (since a locked screen would prevent the agent from seeing the application).
  - Ensure network connectivity to Azure. If the machine is on a secure network, arrange access through a firewall/proxy if needed. Perform a quick connectivity test to Azure OpenAI endpoint.
  - We might also create a dedicated user account under which the agent runs, with limited permissions, and add it to the machine. This way, the agent can run separately from an engineer’s normal login, if that’s a preference.

- **Pilot Deployment:** Initially, deploy the system on a single test bench as a pilot. Have a Honeywell engineer and the development team observe its operation in the real environment. This pilot phase will confirm that nothing was overlooked (for example, maybe the lab PCs have an older OS or lack some library, causing an issue — which we can fix in the installer). It will also serve as a final validation that the system genuinely works end-to-end in the actual lab scenario. During this phase, keep logging at a high detail level to catch any subtle issues.

- **Training and Documentation:** Before scaling up usage, provide training to the relevant team members:
  - Walk through the installation process (if they will install on additional machines themselves).
  - Demonstrate how to start a test, using a simple example.
  - Show how to interpret the log and results.
  - Explain how to abort a test if needed.
  - Provide the documentation (user guide) which includes troubleshooting info and contact info for support (e.g., who to call if something goes wrong).
  - We may conduct a live demo or interactive session with the team to answer questions and build confidence.

- **Wider Deployment:** Install/enable the agent on all target test machines. This could be done manually for each machine or automated if the environment supports it. Since each machine might be slightly different, take care to replicate any settings identified in pilot as important (screen resolution, etc.). It might be useful to maintain a checklist for each installation (e.g., “Configured firewall, placed API key, tested screenshot capture”).

- **Monitoring Initial Runs:** For the first few uses on each machine, have someone monitor the test runs to ensure everything is working. It’s possible that a machine with different performance might reveal a timing issue that wasn’t seen elsewhere. After a number of successful runs, confidence will increase and less monitoring is needed.

- **Feedback Loop:** Establish a channel for feedback and support. Perhaps a weekly call or an email alias where engineers can report issues or suggest enhancements after they start using the agent. Early user feedback will be crucial to quickly resolve any teething problems.

- **Continuous Improvement & Update Deployment:** Plan for deploying updates. For example, if a bug is found and fixed or if an improvement is made, how will that roll out? Options:
  - Provide a new installer version and instructions to update (and perhaps have the agent itself notify “New version available”).
  - Or use an auto-update mechanism (if internet access allows) to fetch updates from a server. Given this is an internal tool, a manual update might be fine.
  - Keep version numbers and change logs so users know what’s changed.

- **Rollback Plan:** If a serious problem occurs with the agent and it cannot be used, the fallback is simply to revert to manual testing (the procedure that was in place before). This ensures that testing can continue. To facilitate rollback or parallel running, the agent doesn’t modify the test application or environment permanently in any way; it’s an add-on. So disabling it is as simple as not running it. From a software perspective, if a particular update of the agent is problematic, maintain access to the previous stable version which can be re-deployed if needed.

- **Success Criteria and Handover:** Define what constitutes a successful deployment (e.g., “The agent has been used for a week of testing with no major issues”). Once reached, consider the project delivered and transition to a maintenance mode. At that point, the documentation and possibly some knowledge transfer sessions should equip the Honeywell team to use and maintain the agent, with Microsoft support available as agreed (perhaps under a support contract or ongoing partnership).

By following this deployment plan, we aim to minimize disruption and build user trust in the solution. The careful pilot and training steps are critical given this is a new type of tool for the team – seeing it in action and understanding how to use it will drive adoption.

## Maintenance and Future Improvements

Once deployed, the system will require ongoing maintenance and offers opportunities for enhancement. Here’s how we plan to manage it:

- **Regular Monitoring and Support:** In the initial phase, the development team (or designated support engineers) will monitor the agent’s usage. This includes checking logs from test runs (with permission) to spot any errors or retries that may not have been reported by users. We will set up a support channel (e.g., an email or Teams channel) where users can report issues or ask questions. Quick turnaround on support requests, especially early on, will help sustain confidence.

- **Issue Tracking and Bug Fixes:** Any defects discovered (e.g., “AI failed to recognize the ‘Enter’ button in a rare screen state” or “application update caused button label to change, confusing the agent”) will be logged in an issue tracker. We’ll prioritize and address them in patch releases. For example, a urgent bug fix might be released as v1.0.1 patch within days if it’s blocking testing. Less critical improvements might be bundled into a periodic update.

- **Adapting to Application Changes:** If the Honeywell application under test is updated (new version with UI changes), the agent may need updates. Because we designed it to be somewhat flexible (AI vision), minor changes (like a moved button) might still be handled, but anything substantial (renamed labels, new workflow) will require updating the agent’s prompts or logic. We will maintain a close relationship with the application’s development schedule; if a new version is upcoming, we’d like to test the agent against a beta of it to adjust in advance.

- **Updating the AI Model:** As Azure’s AI offerings evolve, there may be improved models available or new features (like on-prem deployment of models, or reduced latency versions). We plan to evaluate these and upgrade the agent’s AI integration if there’s a clear benefit. For instance, if a newer model is far better at reading small text on screen or is faster, switching to it could improve performance. Such a switch would go through the same validation as initial development (to ensure no new errors are introduced). Configuration should allow selecting the model, so this might be as simple as changing an endpoint and re-testing.

- **Performance Optimization:** Over time, we might identify performance bottlenecks. For example, if logs show that in 90% of cycles the agent is waiting an extra unnecessary second, we might remove or reduce that wait to speed up tests. We’ll gather metrics (like average time per step) to see if there are opportunities to streamline. One idea for improvement is to move some logic client-side: currently the AI might parse the entire screen each time. If performance is an issue, perhaps use a lighter-weight method for small tasks (like purely OCR for specific known text, which might be quicker than the full model). We can introduce such optimizations in updates, guarded by configurations (so we can toggle them on/off if issues arise).

- **Enhancements and New Features:** Based on user feedback and Honeywell’s evolving needs, we can plan new features:
  - For example, integrating the **advanced anomaly detection** capability: we could start feeding system log data to the AI in parallel with screenshots. This would be a significant new feature, likely requiring additional development and perhaps a separate AI model specialized for log analysis. We would treat this as a Phase 2 project, creating a design and PRD addendum for it.
  - Another potential feature: a more sophisticated UI or dashboard showing multiple agents’ statuses if they run on many machines, so one engineer can monitor all tests from one screen.
  - Support for additional test scenarios: as the team gains confidence, they might want to apply the agent to other operations in the application (not just controller swaps). We’d gather requirements for those and update the agent’s knowledge/prompt to handle them. This might also involve creating a “scenario plugin” system where new sequences can be added via config or script.

- **Preventative Maintenance:** Set up a schedule (maybe quarterly) to review the system’s performance and logs with the team. Check if any new types of errors have crept in or if any part of the process is causing friction. For example, if we notice that testers frequently override a certain step or have to manually intervene at a particular point, that’s a signal to improve the agent there.

- **Documentation Updates:** Keep the documentation up to date with any changes. If new features are added or procedures change, issue updated docs or release notes to the users. Possibly maintain an internal wiki or manual that gets versioned with the software.

- **Knowledge Transfer:** Over time, we may train some key Honeywell personnel on the internals of the system so they can handle minor adjustments. For instance, if it’s mostly a prompt engineering issue, teaching them how the prompt is structured could let them self-service minor tweaks. However, deeper changes or model updates will likely remain with the development team or require collaboration.

- **Scaling Support:** If the usage of the system grows (more users or more machines), ensure support scales as well. This might involve training more support engineers to handle queries, or if the system becomes very stable, reducing active support to on-demand.

- **Retirement of Features:** If some part of the system is not useful or is superseded (for example, if the advanced monitoring becomes active, maybe the way the agent logs certain info changes), plan the deprecation carefully. Announce changes to users and provide transition periods.

Given the critical role of this system in testing, maintenance is crucial. The worst-case scenario would be an unaddressed bug causing false test results or downtime in testing. By actively maintaining and iterating on the system, we aim to prevent that. This maintenance plan ensures the AI agent continues to deliver value and adapts to any changes in the test environment or objectives.

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

Implementing an AI-driven solution comes with several risks. We identify these risks and outline mitigation strategies for each:

- **Risk 1: AI Misinterprets the UI (Vision Error).** There is a risk that the AI might sometimes mis-read the screen – for example, mistaking one button for another or misreading a status text (OCR errors), especially if the screen has low resolution or unusual fonts.
  - *Impact:* Could lead to wrong actions (pressing the wrong button) or false conclusions (thinking a test passed when it actually failed).
  - *Mitigation:* Use high-resolution captures and possibly zoom into areas for the AI to improve reading accuracy. We will also test the model on many screenshots to ensure it’s accurate. Additionally, incorporate redundancy: for critical reads (like the status text), consider using a secondary OCR engine as a cross-check. We can also constrain the model with the UI context (provide it with a list of possible expected values so it’s less likely to hallucinate something outside that list). If uncertainty is detected (e.g., the model’s response is not clearly an actionable command), the agent will default to pausing and asking for help or re-trying the perception step.

- **Risk 2: Slow Performance / High Latency.** The need to call the cloud service for every action could slow down testing. Each AI call could take 1-3 seconds or more, which accumulates in long test sequences.
  - *Impact:* Tests could take significantly longer than manual, reducing some benefits and possibly delaying feedback cycles.
  - *Mitigation:* Optimize by reducing the number of AI calls: if several steps can be predicted or combined, do so. For example, maybe the agent can ask the AI to plan the next 2-3 actions in one shot instead of one by one. Also, use as efficient an API as possible (Azure might have a streaming response or smaller model for quicker decisions). We will measure and tweak timeouts and consider running part of the logic locally (like simple image matching for a known icon instead of asking the AI). If needed, communicate to the team that initial runs might be a bit slower and get their buy-in for the trade-off, emphasizing that it frees their time even if wall-clock is longer. Over time, as tech improves, performance should reach parity or better than manual.

- **Risk 3: Cloud Service Dependency and Downtime.** The solution relies on Azure’s service being accessible and functional. If Azure OpenAI has an outage or the internet connection is down, the agent cannot function (since it can’t decide next steps).
  - *Impact:* Could halt testing when the service is unavailable, causing delays.
  - *Mitigation:* Implement an offline fallback mode if possible. In the short term, that might just mean gracefully exiting and telling the user the AI is unavailable (and then they’d revert to manual testing). We will also cache the last known action if appropriate – for example, if the service goes down mid-run, perhaps the agent can still perform some safe fallback like trying a generic recovery or at least not leaving the system in a weird state. We will coordinate with IT to ensure the test labs have stable internet. Also, having Azure service in a region close to the user can reduce risk of network issues. In the future, if allowed, running an on-prem version of the model (maybe via Azure Stack or container) could remove this dependency.

- **Risk 4: Unintended Actions (Safety).** The AI might attempt an action outside the test scope due to a misunderstanding (e.g., closing the application or clicking something that changes configuration).
  - *Mitigation:* As a rule, we will **restrict the agent’s action set**. The control logic will have an allowlist of actions it can perform. If the AI suggests anything not on the expected path, the agent will log “unexpected action suggested” and ignore it or ask for confirmation (which currently there is no mechanism for, so likely just stop with an error). This way, even a bizarre AI output won’t physically execute a dangerous action. Additionally, during development we’ll tune the AI’s prompt to focus on the task to minimize off-track suggestions. Running the agent in a safe user account and perhaps inside a VM can also contain any potential unintended operations (worst case, it messes up the VM not a real machine).

- **Risk 5: User Resistance or Misuse.** Some testers might be reluctant to trust the AI with a critical process, or conversely might over-trust it and not monitor at all initially. There’s also a learning curve – if they don’t understand how it works, they might use it incorrectly or abandon it after the first hiccup.
  - *Mitigation:* Involve users throughout development (which we are doing). Provide ample training and a phased introduction. Initially, encourage them to monitor a few runs side-by-side with manual to build trust (“see, it did exactly what you would do”). Over time, as confidence builds, they can let it run unattended. We’ll also highlight the logging and transparency features which give them insight into what’s happening. By treating the tool as an assistant rather than a black box, we aim to get buy-in. Also, management support (emphasizing how this will free them for higher-value work) will help encourage adoption. For misuse, clear documentation of what it can and cannot do (don’t, for example, try it on an unsupported scenario without checking with dev team) will be provided.

- **Risk 6: Changes in Test Environment (Maintenance Burden).** If the application or test environment changes frequently, the AI agent might require frequent updates or retraining.
  - *Mitigation:* We have somewhat mitigated this by using an AI that can adapt by understanding the screen, rather than relying purely on fixed coordinates or image templates. So minor UI changes might be handled naturally. For more major changes, we have established in the Maintenance section that we will be updating the agent accordingly. We will also try to make the system data-driven; for example, if the names of certain buttons are configurable in a file, then when they change, editing that file might be enough rather than code changes. Keeping close communication with the product team of the HPS app will allow us to anticipate changes.

- **Risk 7: False Sense of Security (Test Coverage).** Relying on automation might lead to missing things that a human might notice. For instance, a human might see a minor glitch on screen and note it, whereas the AI might be narrowly focused on specific criteria.
  - *Mitigation:* Define the scope of what the AI checks clearly and ensure tests are designed to cover known criteria. For areas where human intuition is valuable, perhaps require a human review of logs or videos from the test at least occasionally. Essentially, we don’t want to fully “blind” the process either; initially, we expect engineers to review the results the AI gathers. Over time, if the AI proves extremely reliable, this risk diminishes. Also, if needed, we could add extra checking mechanisms to the AI (for example, making it flag if something unusual is on screen that it wasn’t looking for, though that’s a hard problem).

- **Risk 8: Project Complexity and Timeline:** Integrating state-of-the-art AI with a legacy system is complex. There is a risk that it takes longer than expected to reach a stable solution, or that some features have to be dropped to meet deadlines.
  - *Mitigation:* Use an agile, iterative approach. Prioritize the most critical capabilities (basic UI navigation and single swap execution) to get a working prototype quickly, then iterate on additional features (loops, advanced error handling, etc.). Communicate regularly with stakeholders about progress and set realistic expectations. Possibly plan a phased rollout: Phase 1 might handle a simpler test scenario or require one-time human setup, and Phase 2 adds more automation. This way, Honeywell can start getting some benefit earlier. We will also keep scope in check: if certain “nice-to-have” features (like a fancy GUI or complete Linux support) are not ready, we can deliver core functionality first and add those soon after.

Each of these risks will be revisited periodically to see if our mitigation strategies are working or if the risk profile has changed. By proactively addressing risks, we aim to ensure a smooth deployment and operation of the AI testing system with no surprises.

## User Experience Considerations

Even though the AI agent operates mostly in the background, the user experience for the engineers interacting with it is important. We want the users to find the tool **helpful, intuitive, and transparent**. Key UX considerations:

- **Ease of Invocation:** Starting a test with the AI agent should be straightforward. If using a command-line, the syntax should be simple (we will provide example commands). If a GUI is provided, it should have minimal inputs required (maybe select a test scenario and press “Start”). The user shouldn’t have to do complex setup each time. For instance, if the application needs to be at a certain screen to start, the agent should handle getting it there, rather than requiring the user to manually prep it.

- **Real-Time Feedback:** As the agent runs, it should give the user an indication of progress. This can be as simple as console output lines or a progress counter. If using a GUI, maybe a status label like “Iteration 3 of 10 in progress…” and perhaps an icon next to it to show it’s working. This feedback helps the user feel confident that the agent hasn’t stalled. Additionally, highlighting what the agent is doing can be useful; for example, printing out “Clicking 'Swap Primary'” right before it does that helps the user follow along. In a perfect scenario, we could even overlay a highlight on the application itself (like a colored border around the button it’s about to press) – though that might be complex to implement, it’s an idea for transparency.

- **Transparency of AI Decisions:** The agent’s log and possibly its UI should make it clear **why** it is doing what it’s doing. For instance, if it waits, it could log “Waiting for status to change to ONLINE…”. If it decides to abort, it should log the reason (“Detected error dialog: 'Controller Failure' – aborting test.”). This way, users can understand the AI’s behavior. We want to avoid a scenario where the user is scratching their head wondering, “Why did it stop?” or “Why is it waiting so long now?” The more the agent can explain itself (through logs or messages), the more trust it will earn.

- **Ability to Pause/Abort:** Give users control to intervene if needed. There should be a clear way to stop the test in the middle. In a CLI, this could be as simple as pressing Ctrl+C (we will handle that signal gracefully). In a GUI, a “Stop” button is essential. Possibly a “Pause” is useful too, which would tell the agent to finish the current action and then hold, allowing the user to, say, inspect the system state before resuming. While we intend for fully autonomous operation, having these controls is important for user comfort and for debugging (pause is useful if someone wants to see what’s on screen at a given point without the agent immediately reacting).

- **Learning Curve and Onboarding:** We will not assume every user is familiar with AI agents. The first-time experience should be guided. This means:
  - Provide a **quick-start guide** with step-by-step instructions for the most common use case.
  - Possibly include a dry-run mode (for example, a flag `--dry-run` that goes through the motions without actually clicking, just logging what it *would* do). This can help users see how the agent thinks without affecting the system.
  - If using CLI, make sure `--help` prints useful information. If GUI, maybe have tooltips or a short tutorial dialog.
  - Use terminology in outputs that the users are familiar with (for example, refer to things using the same names as in their documentation: if they call it “Swap Primary” button, use that term in logs, not something like “Toggle Button”).

- **Non-intrusiveness:** The agent should minimize any impact on the user’s machine outside the test scope. It should, for example, not resize the application window to full screen unless necessary (because that might annoy someone who had it sized a certain way). It should also not interfere with other apps. Ideally, the user would dedicate a machine or at least not use the machine while the agent runs, but if they are, ensure the agent’s operation (like moving mouse) is isolated to the test app (the app could be run in a VM or we restrict input to that window). Document the expectation that while the agent is running, the machine should be left idle for best results (to avoid the user fighting over mouse control with the agent, for instance).

- **Error Messages:** When something goes wrong that stops the agent, the message/report should clearly state the cause in user-friendly terms. E.g., “**Error:** Network connection lost. Could not reach AI service. The test has been stopped. Please check your internet connection and try again.” or “**Error:** The application did not respond for 60 seconds after clicking 'Swap'. The agent stopped the test. You may need to investigate a potential application hang.” These kinds of messages let the user know it’s the system or environment at fault, not something they did. Avoid vague messages like “Exception in module X” – those are for developers, not end users.

- **Post-test Artifacts:** Ensure the outputs (logs and summary) are easily accessible. For instance, after a run, if using CLI, indicate “Log saved to C:\Logs\SwapTest_01.log” and maybe open the summary or print it. If using GUI, maybe show the summary on screen and offer a button to open the full log file. If screenshots on failure were captured, inform the user where to find them. This makes their job of reporting or analyzing issues easier.

- **Customization vs. Simplicity:** We need to balance giving power users the ability to tweak things with keeping it simple for others. The approach is to have sensible defaults and a smooth basic flow, but also allow advanced config. For example, a power user might want to modify the threshold for OCR confidence or change how long to wait for a certain operation (maybe because they know their system can take up to 2 minutes to reboot a controller). We will allow such tweaks through the config file. But in the normal usage path, the user shouldn’t need to touch these – they’re pre-tuned to reasonable values. Document the config options for those interested.

- **User Feedback Integration:** Provide an easy way for users to give feedback from within the tool. This could be as simple as including a line in the output “For feedback or to report issues, contact ___” or a link in documentation. Making it easy encourages them to report minor annoyances that we can fix to improve UX further.

In essence, we want the user experience to be that the agent is a **reliable assistant**: one that is easy to start, communicates what it’s doing, and yields helpful information. The users should feel in control (able to stop it, able to understand it) even as it automates their work. A good UX will drive adoption and ultimately the success of this tool in the testing process.
